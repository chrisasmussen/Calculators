# Calculator

## About

There are two folders in this project directory. One folder contains a C++ program that will convert from binary to decimal and the other contains the inverse. Each file should be compiled into its own executable. I recommend using g++. A tutorial can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiling-with-g-plus-plus/) on how to use g++.

### Language

Both conversion calculators are written in C++.
